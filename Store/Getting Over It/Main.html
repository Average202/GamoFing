 <h3>About this Game</h3>
 
 <p>I made a game for a certain kind of person. To hurt them.</p>
 
 
 
 <p><strong>Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</strong> is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo's 2002 B-Game classic 'Sexy Hiking'. You move the hammer with the mouse, and that's all there is. With practice, you'll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain.</p>
 <br>
 <p>To quote Jazzuo himself:<i>"The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well".</i></p>
 <p>• Climb up an enormous mountain with nothing but a hammer and a pot.</p>
 <p>• Listen as I make philosophical observations about the problem at hand.</p>
 <p>• Between 2 and ∞ hours of agonizing gameplay, depending. The median time to finish for my playtesters was 5 hours, but the mean was closer to ∞.</p>
 <p>• Lose all your progress, over and over.</p>
 <p>• Feel new types of frustration you didn't know you were capable of.</p>
